### Heyo 👋

I am a high school student from Germany with a passion for coding 🇩🇪. My journey into programming began a few years ago, and since then, I’ve dedicated myself to mastering this skill 🤖. Deep Learning captivates me the most, and I am currently channeling my efforts into developing my own deep learning framework 🧠.

This year, I am excited about the prospect of representing Germany at the International Olympiad in Informatics (IOI) 🐫. Additionally, I am working hard with the goal of securing victory in the Bundeswettbewerb Informatik (BWINF) 🥨.

Should you wish to connect or discuss Deep Learning and programming, please don’t hesitate to reach out via email samsun2006@icloud.com 📬.
